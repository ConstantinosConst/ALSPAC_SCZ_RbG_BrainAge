### Step 1. Sample selection and relevant variables
A desicription of the ALSPAC variables (and recoding) used for the current analyses can be found in the relevant spreadsheet: 'Variables_Info_CC_02102023.xlsx'. The R code used to extract the SCZ-RbG subsample (and relevant variables) from the wider ALSPAC dataset will be added soon. 

### Step 2. Brain age estimation
a. For guidance on brain age prediction using the ENIGMA model, please refer to the following resources: (a) https://photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage, (b) https://github.com/ConstantinosConst/ENIGMA-SZ-BrainAge

b. For guidance on brain age prediction using the the CentileBrain model (sensitivity analysis), please refer to the following resource:

### Step 3. Statistical analyses
The R code used for statistical analyses (incl. sample discriptives and data visualisation) can be found in the relevant script: 'ALSPAC_SCZ_RbG_BA_Stats_15092023'
